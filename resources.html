            <h2>Sources of Protein</h2>
            <p>Protein is essential for the growth, repair, and maintenance of body tissues, including muscles and organs. It also plays a vital role in the immune system and hormone production.</p>
            <h3>Animal-Based Sources</h3>
            <p>Animal-based proteins are considered complete proteins because they contain all nine essential amino acids. These are some of the best sources:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chicken:</strong> A lean source of protein that is low in fat.</li>
                <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> High in protein and essential nutrients such as vitamins A, B12, and D.</li>
                <li><strong>Fish:</strong> Salmon, tuna, and mackerel are rich in protein and omega-3 fatty acids.</li>
                <li><strong>Greek Yogurt:</strong> Offers a good amount of protein along with probiotics, which support gut health.</li>
                <li><strong>Milk:</strong> A complete source of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.</li>
                <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> High in protein, calcium, and other vital nutrients.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Plant-Based Sources</h3>
            <p>Plant-based protein sources are also great for vegetarians and vegans. While they may not always provide all the essential amino acids, you can combine different sources to meet your protein needs.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lentils:</strong> High in fiber and protein, making them a great addition to soups and stews.</li>
                <li><strong>Tofu:</strong> A versatile soy-based protein source that can be grilled, stir-fried, or added to soups.</li>
                <li><strong>Quinoa:</strong> A complete protein that contains all nine essential amino acids.</li>
                <li><strong>Chia Seeds:</strong> Packed with protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and fiber.</li>
                <li><strong>Almonds:</strong> A good source of protein, healthy fats, and vitamin E.</li>
                <li><strong>Edamame:</strong> Young soybeans rich in protein, fiber, and essential micronutrients.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Precautions</h3>
            <p>While protein is crucial for health, consuming too much can strain the kidneys. Ensure you balance your protein intake with other essential nutrients. Plant-based proteins often lack one or more essential amino acids, so combining them (e.g., beans and rice) is a good strategy.</p>

            <h2>Sources of Carbohydrates</h2>
            <p>Carbohydrates are the body’s main source of energy. They are broken down into glucose, which is used by cells for energy. Carbs can be categorized as simple or complex, with complex carbs being healthier options.</p>
            <h3>Simple Carbohydrates</h3>
            <p>These carbs are rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream and can cause spikes in blood sugar. They are found in foods like sweets and refined grains.</p>

                <li><strong>Coconut Oil:</strong> While it contains healthy medium-chain triglycerides, it’s also high in saturated fat.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Avoid Trans Fats</h3>
