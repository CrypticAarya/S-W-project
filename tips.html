            <h2>Recommended Daily Intake of Protein</h2>
            <p>Protein is one of the essential macronutrients that your body needs to function properly. It plays a vital role in building and repairing tissues, producing enzymes and hormones, and supporting immune function. The recommended daily intake (RDI) for protein depends on factors such as age, gender, physical activity level, and health goals. Here’s a more detailed guide:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>General Adults:</strong> 0.8g per kilogram of body weight (example: 56g for a 70kg person).</li>
                <li><strong>Active Adults:</strong> 1.2g to 2.0g per kilogram of body weight (example: 84g to 140g for a 70kg person).</li>
                <li><strong>Athletes:</strong> Protein is especially important for athletes to aid muscle recovery. For endurance athletes, around 1.2g to 1.4g of protein per kilogram is suggested. Strength athletes may require up to 2g per kilogram.</li>
                <li><strong>Pregnant/Breastfeeding Women:</strong> Protein intake should be increased to 1.1g per kilogram of body weight to support the growth of the baby and to produce breast milk.</li>
                <li><strong>Elderly Individuals:</strong> Protein needs may increase to around 1.0-1.2g per kilogram to help maintain muscle mass and strength as we age.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Best Sources of Protein</h3>
            <p>High-quality protein sources include lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy products, beans, legumes, and plant-based options like tofu, tempeh, and quinoa.</p>

        <section id="carbs">
            <h2>Recommended Daily Intake of Carbohydrates</h2>
            <p>Carbohydrates are your body’s main source of energy. They are found in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and sugary foods. Carbs are broken down into glucose (sugar), which is used by your cells for energy. The amount of carbohydrates you need depends on your activity level, health goals, and total calorie intake. Here’s the breakdown:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>General Adult Population:</strong> 45-65% of total daily calories should come from carbohydrates. For a 2,000-calorie diet, that’s about 225-325g of carbs per day.</li>
                <li><strong>Endurance Athletes:</strong> 6-10g of carbohydrates per kilogram of body weight. For a 70kg person, this could be between 420g to 700g of carbs daily.</li>
                <li><strong>Diabetics:</strong> It’s crucial to manage carbohydrate intake by limiting fast-digesting carbs (like refined sugars). Focus on complex carbs like whole grains, legumes, and vegetables that provide steady energy and fiber.</li>
                <li><strong>Children and Adolescents:</strong> Just like adults, carbohydrates should make up 45-65% of daily calories. However, the portion sizes should be adjusted for age and activity level.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Types of Carbohydrates</h3>
            <p>There are two types of carbohydrates: simple and complex. Simple carbohydrates are found in sugary foods and drinks, whereas complex carbs are found in whole grains, legumes, and starchy vegetables. Aim to get most of your carbs from complex sources, as they are more nutritious and take longer to digest.</p>

        <section id="fats">
            <h2>General Recommendations for Fat Intake</h2>
            <p>Fats are essential for energy storage, hormone production, and cell function. However, not all fats are created equal. Some fats are beneficial, while others can be harmful. The key is to balance the types of fat you consume. Here are the general guidelines for fat intake:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Total Fat:</strong> Should make up 20-35% of your total daily calories. For a 2,000-calorie diet, that’s around 44-78 grams of fat per day.</li>
                <li><strong>Saturated Fat:</strong> Limit saturated fat to less than 10% of total calories. This would be less than 22 grams for a 2,000-calorie diet.</li>
                <li><strong>Trans Fat:</strong> Avoid trans fats entirely, as they raise bad cholesterol levels and increase the risk of heart disease.</li>
                <li><strong>Monounsaturated and Polyunsaturated Fats:</strong> These healthy fats should make up the majority of your fat intake. Sources include olive oil, avocado, nuts, fatty fish, and flaxseeds.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Healthy Fat Sources</h3>
            <p>Some of the best sources of healthy fats include olive oil, avocados, nuts (e.g., almonds, walnuts), seeds, and fatty fish (e.g., salmon, mackerel, sardines).</p>

        <section id="vitamins">
            <h2>Recommended Daily Intake of Vitamins</h2>
            <p>Vitamins are essential nutrients that help support various functions in your body, including metabolism, immunity, and cell repair. Below are the general recommendations for daily vitamin intake:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vitamin A:</strong> 900 mcg (men), 700 mcg (women). Important for eye health, immune function, and cell growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Vitamin C:</strong> 90 mg (men), 75 mg (women). An antioxidant that helps with skin health and immune function.</li>
                <li><strong>Vitamin D:</strong> 20 mcg (800 IU). Vital for bone health and calcium absorption.</li>
                <li><strong>Vitamin E:</strong> 15 mg. Acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Vitamin K:</strong> 120 mcg (men), 90 mcg (women). Essential for blood clotting and bone health.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Vitamin B Complex</h3>
            <p>The B vitamins are crucial for energy production and metabolic processes. B1 (Thiamin), B2 (Riboflavin), B3 (Niacin), B6, B12, and Folate are all important in the breakdown of food and the maintenance of healthy skin, hair, and eyes.</p>
